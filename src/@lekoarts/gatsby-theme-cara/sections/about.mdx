I am a German college student studying computer science at Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen in Gie√üen. I love to play intellectually challangeing video games like Stellaris, Arma 3, Minecraft, etc. I am also one of the top three managers of Theyphania - a German roleplaying community, the Pixel Team Supervisor over at Thelyn Ennor and the leading technician of Regia Aquila.
