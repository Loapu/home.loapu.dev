I am a German student of computer science at the 'Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen' in Giessen. I love playing intellectually challenging video games like Stellaris, Arma 3, Minecraft, etc. I am also one of three Senior Managers at [Theyphania](https://theyphania.de) - a German role-playing community, the Pixel Team Supervisor at [Thelyn Ennor](https://www.thelyn-ennor.eu) and the Leading Technician at [Regia Aquila](https://www.regia-aquila.de).
